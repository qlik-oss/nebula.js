          We updated our route which was previously had the responsibility to handle the redirected link including the
          correct credentials to have{' '}
          <code>
            <b>/auth/</b>
          </code>{' '}
          part within it. This change is now impacting your redirect links if you already using your old client-id.

          Here is what you need to do:
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          <b>1.</b> Go to your tenant that you created your client id
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>2.</b> Open Managment console
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>3.</b> Click on OAuth menu in left panel (if you dont see that menu it means you dont have access to it and
          you need to ask a person who has the proper access)
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>4.</b> Find your Client id and from ... menu, click on edit
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>5.</b> There is a section called &quot;Add redirect URLs&quot;, find it and add your new link. The only
          difference is that your new link will include `/auth/` part in it, for example, if you had this redirect link
          previously:
          <code>http://localhost:8000/login/callback</code>
          <br />
          now it will be like:
          <code>
            http://localhost:8000/<b>auth/</b>login/callback
          </code>
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>6.</b> Click on save and you are set!
          <br />
        </Typography>
      </ContentWrapper>
    </ThemeWrapper>
  );
};

export default OAuthRedirectLinkError;
