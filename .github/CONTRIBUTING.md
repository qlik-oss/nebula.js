### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 10+ and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) 1.9.4 installed

### Project structure

This is a multi-package repository which uses [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) for package task management and publishing.

- `apis` - JavaScript APIs
  - `nucleus`: JavaScript library for mashups
  - `supernova`: JavaScript API for consuming and visualizing QIX data
  - `stardust`: Public JavaScript API which exposes the nucleus and supernova APIs
- `commands` - CLI commands
  - `build`: cli command to build a supernova
  - `cli`: entry point for all cli commands
  - `create`: cli command for creating a supernova project
  - `sense`: cli command to build a Qlik Sense extension from a supernova
  - `serve`: cli command to start a development server for rapid prototyping of a supernova
- `packages`
  - `ui`: [private] ui components
- `test/`: contains test configs

### Development workflow

- `yarn` generates UMD bundles for all packages
- `yarn run build`
- `yarn run lint` checks code style
- `yarn run test` runs all tests

### Cutting a release

**Prerelase**

```sh
npx lerna version --no-git-tag-version --no-push --no-conventional-commits --preid alpha --exact
```

## <a name="git"></a> Git Guidelines

Generally, development should be done directly towards the `master` branch.

### Branching

1. Fork and clone the repository

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/nebula.js.git
   ```

1. Create a branch in the fork

   The branch should be based on the `master` branch in the master repository.

   ```sh
   git checkout -b my-feature-or-bugfix master
   ```

1. Commit changes on your branch

   Commit changes to your branch, following the commit message format.

   ```sh
   git commit -m "fix: properly formatted SET statements."
   ```

1. Push the changes to your fork

   ```sh
   git push -u myfork my-feature-or-bugfix
   ```

1. Create a Pull Request

   > Before creating a Pull Request, make sure to sign the [CLA](#cla)

   In the Github UI of your fork, create a Pull Request to the `master` branch of the master repository.

   If the branch has merge conflicts or has been outdated, please do a rebase against the `master` branch.

### <a name="commit"></a> Commit message guidelines
