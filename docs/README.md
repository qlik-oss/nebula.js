## What is nebula.js?

`nebula.js` is a collection of JavaScript libraries and APIs that helps developers integrate visualizations and mashups on top of Qlik's Associative Engine.

It consists of three parts:

- `nucleus`: A product and framework agnostic JavaScript library for building mashups.
- `supernova`: A JavaScript API for consuming and visualizing QIX data.
- `cli`: Tools to help you create, develop and build a `supernova`.
