## What is nebula.js?

`nebula.js` is a collection of JavaScript libraries, visualizations and CLIs that helps developers build and integrate visualizations on top of Qlik's Associative Engine.

The collection is organized under the `@nebula.js` scope in the form of npm packages. The primary package is `@nebula.js/stardust` which contains APIs for integrating existing visualizations with mashups, as well as APIs for building custom visualizations.
