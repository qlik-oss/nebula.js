# Locale specific strings

The English resource (string) container [`en-US.json`](./en-US.json) on `master` is monitored for changes. All modifications will automatically be picked up and propagated to the other locale files by the Globalization Services team at Qlik at regular intervals (weekly).

## Pull requests touching English string resources

Please add [dechabot (Dan Chabot)](https://github.com/dechabot) for review on all PRs touching [English string resources](./en-US.json), to ensure changes are consistent with style guides and translatability requirements.

**Important**

Any changes to **non-English files** will be overwritten on next translation delivery. If you need to modify the non-English strings for any reason, please contact Qlik Globalization Services via [@qlik-oss/globalization](https://github.com/orgs/qlik-oss/teams/globalization).
